Welcome fellow AFX devs!

First, install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper, if you don't have it already. Use pip to install.

Create two virtual envs, one for dev and one for testing.

I have requirements files for all the stuff you need:


$ workon afx_dev
$ pip install -r requirements/development.txt
 
$ workon afx_test
$ pip install -r requirements/testing.txt
